      <p class="heading"><em>NOW more than ever…………….</em>
      </p><p class="text"><em>If there was ever a time when people need a realtor, it is now!!&nbsp; </em></p>
      <p class="text">At this crucial time, in a  changing 
market, people need a hard working, honest, and knowledgeable realtor  
to help them through this challenging market.&nbsp;  At a time when 
numerous realtors are deciding to try other careers, is  the time when 
Sheri Tilton just digs in her heels and works even harder to  fulfill 
her client's needs and expectations.&nbsp;  She is firmly committed to 
her career in Real Estate, and will continue  to be there to listen 
carefully to you, and will definitely &#8220;<strong><em>Go  the Extra Mile</em></strong>&#8221; to serve your Real Estate needs.&nbsp; Her professionalism and expertise are the  difference you cannot afford to be without.<br>
        <br>
        Sheri’s background work history  and extreme work ethics have 
been a huge advantage and a real benefit for her  clients.&nbsp; With 
her 6 years of being a  builder, along with working with her husband in 
excavation, her extensive  background in both building and excavation 
has contributed towards her  knowledge and expertise in her real estate 
career.&nbsp; She has physically been down in the ditches  installing 
numerous drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines.&nbsp; She can 
point out the difference of an older  3 tab roof verses an updated 
architectural roof, explain the difference between  an active and 
passive radon system, and can try to determine on how difficult  it may 
be to add that 3rd bathroom in the basement depending on the  location 
of the plumbing and where the elevation of the septic or sewer line is  
entering the home if it is even visible.&nbsp;  She&nbsp; will 
normally&nbsp; check out the electrical panel boxes to see  if they are a
 Federal Pacific brand, for they have been recalled, along with  the era
 of when the LP siding had the class action suit.<br>
        <br>
        The excavation background has  been a huge benefit for her 
clients that are looking at raw land with the dream  of building their 
own home.&nbsp; She has a  general knowledge of the different types of 
soil, with the potential types of  septic systems they could be up 
against.&nbsp;  She’s always looking for the perfect slope to provide 
the desirable  daylight walk-out basement, and points out to her clients
 on where the sun  rises and sets, so they can determine on how they may
 want to design their  home.&nbsp; Evening shade is perfect for those  
summer BBQ’s!<br>
        <br>
        With Sheri also having a long  lasting love for horses since she
 was a small girl, she has a tremendous amount  of knowledge in the 
equestrian properties.&nbsp;  She owns a beautiful black quarter horse 
that she is very proud to say has been used in a therapeutic riding 
program for handicapped children and  adults.&nbsp; She also has a 
gorgeous  Appaloosa Mule in which she has shown and won against the 
horses.&nbsp; The many years of horse ownership is also a  large benefit
 for her equestrian clients.<br>
        <br>
        If you are currently in the  market for an existing home, 
looking to build a new home, or are interested in  an equestrian 
property, you need to rely on Sheri Tilton’s expertise.&nbsp; She will 
definitely <strong><em>&#8220;Go the Extra Mile&#8221; </em></strong>for  you.&nbsp;
