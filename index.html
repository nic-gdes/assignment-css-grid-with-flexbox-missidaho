                    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
                    <!-- <h4>NOW more than ever…………….</h4> -->
                    <p>

                        Sheri’s background work history and extreme work ethics have been a huge advantage and a real
                        benefit for her clients. With her 6 years of being a builder, along with working with her
                        husband in
                        excavation, her extensive background in both building and excavation has contributed towards her
                        knowledge and expertise in her real estate career. She has physically been down in the ditches
                        installing numerous drain fields, septic systems, and sewer lines. She can point out the
                        difference
                        of an older 3 tab roof verses an updated architectural roof, explain the difference between an
                        active and passive radon system, and can try to determine on how difficult it may be to add that
                        3rd
                        bathroom in the basement depending on the location of the plumbing and where the elevation of
                        the
                        septic or sewer line is entering the home if it is even visible. She will normally check out the
                        electrical panel boxes to see if they are a Federal Pacific brand, for they have been recalled,
                        along with the era of when the LP siding had the class action suit.

                    <h3>More About Her</h3>
                    <!-- <h4>NOW more than ever…………….</h4> -->
                    <p>

                        The excavation background has been a huge benefit for her clients that are looking at raw land
                        with
                        the dream of building their own home. She has a general knowledge of the different types of
                        soil,
                        with the potential types of septic systems they could be up against. She’s always looking for
                        the
                        perfect slope to provide the desirable daylight walk-out basement, and points out to her clients
                        on
                        where the sun rises and sets, so they can determine on how they may want to design their home.

                    <p> With Sheri also having a long lasting love for horses since she was a small girl, she has a
                        tremendous amount of knowledge in the equestrian properties. She owns a beautiful black quarter
                        horse that she is very proud to say has been used in a therapeutic riding program for
                        handicapped
                        children and adults. She also has a gorgeous Appaloosa Mule in which she has shown and won
                        against
                        the horses. The many years of horse ownership is also a large benefit for her equestrian
                        clients.
